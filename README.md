The front-end development of Waslni was done using the following technologies:

The front-end code includes the use of the Fetch API for performing CRUD operations with the back end. Async/await commands were utilized for handling asynchronous operations. Bootstrap framework was employed for building some of the project's pages. The user interface was designed by the FE team, with collaboration and input from other team members.
